# 🤖 GoDev Hackaton

Goal:

Develop an Azure Function that implements a machine learning model using Scikit-learn or PyTorch. The function should take input data via an HTTP POST request, process the data using the ML model, and return predictions as a JSON response.
Bonus Points: Focus on plant care, plant type recognition, or plant health classification using image data.
